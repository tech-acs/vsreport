<p>There are several civil registration variables required to create the
tables and figures included in a Vital Statistics report. This vignette
presents all of the necessary variables and maps them to the
corresponding tables and figures.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows all of the civil registration variables needed to
populate the tables and figures required in a Vital Statistics report.
The rows can be expanded by event registration type (Birth, Death,
Marriage, Divorce) and by characteristic (Newborn, Mother, Decedent,
Bride, Groom, Wife and Husband).</p>

<p>The input data from civil registration systems need to be structured
following the variable names and data types listed in Table 1.</p>
<p>The tables and figures for the vital statistics report are split by
event registration type: Birth, Death, Marriage and Divorce. Filter
Table 2 by event and characteristic then click to expand the row to show
the variables required for each output. Each table has a number in
brackets which refers to the number of variables needed to build it.</p>

<p>Once the appropriate variables have been prepared you can start to
generate the tables. For example, if you want to create Table 4.7 which
is â€˜Live births by site of occurrenceâ€™. If you enter â€˜T4.7â€™ into the
search box in Table 2 you will see that there are 5 variables
required:</p>
<ul>
<li>birth1a (Date of occurrence, Event)</li>
<li>birth1b (Date of registration, Event)</li>
<li>birth1c (Place of occurrence, Event)</li>
<li>birth1h (Attendant at birth, Event)</li>
<li>birth1i (Type of place of occurrence (hospital, home, etc.),
Event)</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these variables correspond to the Birth registration event
rather than characteristics of the Newborn or Mother.</p>
<p>To create Table 4.7 we can run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">t4_07</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">create_table_4.7</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">bth_data</span>, </span>

<span>                         tablename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Table_4_7"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
