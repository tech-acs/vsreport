<p>There are several variables required to create the tables and figures
included in a Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS) report.
This vignette presents all of the necessary variables and maps them to
the corresponding tables and figures.</p>
<p>Table 1 shows all of the variables needed to populate the tables and
figures required in the CRVS report. The table can be filtered by event
registration type (Birth, Death, Marriage, Divorce) and by
characteristic (Newborn, Mother, Decedent, Bride, Groom, Wife and
Husband).</p>
<p>The input data from civil registration systems need to be structured
following the variable names and data types listed in Table 1.</p>

<p>The tables and figures for the CRVS report are split by event
registration type: Birth, Death, Marriage and Divorce. Filter Table 2 by
event and characteristic then click to expand the row to show the
variables required for each output. Each table has a number in brackets
which refers to the number of variables needed to build it.</p>

<p>Once the appropriate variables have been prepared you can start to
generate the tables.</p>
<p>For example, weâ€™d like to create Table 4.7 which is â€˜Births by site
of deliveryâ€™. If you enter â€˜T4.7â€™ into the search box in Table 2 you
will see that there are 5 variables required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date of occurrence</li>
<li>Date of registration</li>
<li>Place of occurrence</li>
<li>Attendant at birth; and Type of place of occurrence (hospital, home,
etc.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these variables correspond to the Birth registration event
rather than characteristics of the Newborn or Mother.</p>
<p>To create Table 4.7 we can run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">t4.7</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">create_table_4.7</span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">bth_data</span>, </span>
<span>                         <span class="va">dobyr</span>, </span>
<span>                         <span class="fl">2022</span>, </span>
<span>                         tablename <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"Table_4_7"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
