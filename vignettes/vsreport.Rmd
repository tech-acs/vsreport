## Introduction

`vsreport` is an R package designed to help with the creation of
CRVS reports from record level data. It will produce tables in line with the
best practice for CRVS reports.

## Simple installation and Basic Usage

In order to use the `vsreport` as part of your pipeline with your data,
you will need to follow these straight forward commands:

### 1) Install and Load the `devtools` Package

Install and load the `devtools` package if you haven't already.
This will let you install packages from GitHub directly.

```r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

### 2) Install the `vsreport` Package from GitHub

Use the `install_github()` function from the `devtools` package to install.
You need to provide the repository address in the format username/repository.

```r
devtools::install_github("tech-acs/vsreport")
```

During this installation, you will be asked to install some required packages
so that the `vsreport` works correctly, this might take a few minutes.
You might get some errors if your `R` installation is old or there are some
necessary package updates, usually the messages on the Console are descriptive.

### 3) Use the `vsreport` Package in your Script

Once you have installed the package, here is a basic example of how to use
__vsreport__:

```r
library(crvspackage)

# Example Usage
age_grp_80 <- construct_age_groups(ageinyrs, start_age = 5, max_band = 80,
                                        step_size = 5, under_1 = TRUE)
```

## Sample Data Included in the Package

The package has four test datasets, one for each of:

- Birth data: Use the `construct_sample_birth_data()` function.
- Death data: Use the `construct_sample_death_data()` function.
- Marriages data: Use the `construct_sample_marriage_data()` function.
- Divorce data: Use the `construct_sample_divorce_data()` function.

This test data should also serve as a good tool in order to test existing features
or develop new ones.
