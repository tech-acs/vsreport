CRVS reports from record level data. It will produce tables in line with the
best practice for CRVS reports.

In order to use the `crvsreportpackage` as part of your pipeline with your data,
you will need to follow these straight forward commands:

### 1) Install and Load the `devtools` Package

install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

### 2) Install the `crvsreportpackage` Package from GitHub

Use the `install_github()` function from the `devtools` package to install.

```

During this installation, you will be asked to install some required packages
so that the `crvsreportpackage` works correctly, this might take a few minutes.
You might get some errors if your `R` installation is old or there are some
necessary package updates, usually the messages on the Console are descriptive.

### 3) Use the `crvsreportpackage` Package in your Script

Once you have installed the package, here is a basic example of how to use
__crvsreportpackage__:

```r
library(crvspackage)

# Example Usage
age_grp_80 <- construct_age_groups(ageinyrs, start_age = 5, max_band = 80,
                                        step_size = 5, under_1 = TRUE)
```

## Sample Data Included in the Package

The package has four test datasets, one for each of:

- Birth data: Use the `construct_sample_birth_data()` function.
- Death data: Use the `construct_sample_death_data()` function.
- Marriages data: Use the `construct_sample_marriage_data()` function.
- Divorce data: Use the `construct_sample_divorce_data()` function.
